## My Process

### Technoliges Used
-  CSS
- JavaScript

### What I Learned

I learned a lot of javascript doing this project:
- DOM Manipulation
- How to create an array of objects.
- How to create elements and insert them into the DOM.
- How to pass a function with data to another function.
- Event Listeners.
- Using the Console for Errors

I did find this project daunting, as it was the first time adding epic multiple lines of javascript to a project. üôÉ  
However, the more lines of javascript I created that worked, the more excited I felt about javascript and part of the excitement was finally using javascript creatively. It was even fun using the console to understand my errors.

### Continued Development

In the future I would like to add:
- Audio, as in some Harry Potter music for different events.
- Add some media queries and start with a mobile-first approach.
- Possibly some animation with javascript.

### Resources
- [How to get Last Element of an Array in Javascript?](https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-get-last-item-array-javascript/) - This helped me understand how to get the last element in an array when you don't know how many items are in an array.
